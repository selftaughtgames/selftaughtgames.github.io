      <p>
        Welcome to the inaugural post of Self-Taught Games!  This will be a (hopefully) daily log of what’s going on with this site. 
      </p>

      <h3>What I'm Working On</h3>

      <p>Right now, all activities are focused around getting this site up 
        and running. Brushing up on my HTML and CSS, and trying to learn new tricks I can apply to this project.  
      </p>


      <h3>What I'm Studying</h3>

      <p>Web Development is my chief focus right now as I work on building up this website. 
        I started watching 
      <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/"> "The Web 
        Developer Bootcamp"</a> by Colt Steele on Udemy. So far I'm finding it useful. He’s a pretty good  
        instructor.  Presents things in a clear and thorough manner without being 
        annoying or hard to follow. Will give a fuller review once I finish the class.
      </p>
      
      <h3>What I'm Playing</h3>

     <p>Oddly enough, Animal Crossing.  Not my typical game.  I’ve never played any of the 
       Animal Crossing games before.  But with current events being heavily focused on 
       the Corona Virus and California on lockdown, I’m finding it strangely relaxing 
       to play.  My little colony of Covid Cove is growing nicely, the music is super 
       chill, and it’s just got this really peaceful vibe.  Not sure how long I will stick with it.  Already there are 
       things like Bunny Day that I'm finding annoying.  But considering how stressful the real world is right now, the simplicity of this 
       game is a nice escape.

      <h3>Stray Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        Right now this site is just a sad little skeleton of a website.  Just one page, basic HTML, no CSS.  I decided to start the blog today and throw it out into the wild 
        even though it's raw and not ready yet because I've got a horrible habit of procrastinating and never actually starting things.  I've been kicking the idea of this website around for a 
        long time now and I figure with the Covid-19 shelter in place order and the extra time I have on my hands if I don't start it now, I probably never will and should just give up on the idea.
        </p>
        
        <p> So as it seems like I'd be a fool to keep procrastinating this project any longer I've decided that in my spare time I'm going to actually 
        start building this thing, and blog about it all the while as a way to build the habit of working on it every day and light a fire under my ass to keep going and not quit.</p>
        <p>So as the days and weeks go by you will get to see me take this one little page and hopefully grow it into a fully modern looking website that has interesting and useful content.  It's a work in progress,
          and likely always will be one.  But it feels good to finally take that first step and officially launch this website.  Here's hoping I stick with it and there is another post tomorrow!
